# Handwritten Digit Recognizer

This project is a simple neural network implemented in Python using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to recognize handwritten digits (0–9). The model is trained on the **MNIST dataset** and can predict digits drawn manually.

## Features
- Train a neural network on MNIST dataset.
- Save and load the trained model.
- Predict digits from your own drawn images.
- Automatic pre-processing: resizing, grayscale, color inversion, and normalization.
- Visualization of predictions with `matplotlib`.

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Handwritten-Digit-Recognizer.git
